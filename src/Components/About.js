          <p>
            Hi! Iâ€™m a passionate and dedicated <strong>Full-Stack Java Developer</strong> 
            with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in building responsive and interactive web applications 
            using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js</strong>. On the backend, 
            I work with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, <strong>Hibernate</strong>, and 
            <strong>MySQL</strong> for robust and scalable server-side development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy crafting clean, efficient code and designing user-friendly interfaces
            that deliver great experiences. I'm always eager to learn new tools and 
            frameworks, and I thrive in environments where I can grow, collaborate, and 
            contribute to impactful projects.
          </p>
